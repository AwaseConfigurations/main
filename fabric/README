Documentation for fabfile methods and a generic guide to using the commands.

In Fabric you have a certain syntax to use with each command. After installing fabric it runs with fab install type of command in terminal. When the command requires a parameter like in the install command you can either simply pass it after the command like this fab install:geany or you can name the parameter like fab install:package=”geany”. Several parameters should be separated with a comma.
To mix things up a bit we then have fabrics internal parameters you can add such as hosts or roles. To pass the command only to specific machines you can add parameter hosts=”admin@host.local;admin@host2.local” or to a set of hosts specified in fabfile roles roles=”workstations”. So to install geany in all workstations we would put it like fab install:geany,roles=”workstations” or to install geany on just host3 we would do fab install:geany,hosts=”admin@host3.local” noting that admin is the user we have installed on the host computer that has rights to do such changes.

fab -l lists all the available commands and their short descriptions.
